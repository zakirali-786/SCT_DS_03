PREDICTION BASED ANALYSIS
Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction

This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (y) based on demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
.
üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Explore customer demographic and behavioral data.

Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Train classification models to predict customer subscription (y).

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
